        For the first time, these original touch tables are available for short and long term rentals. These unique interactive multitouch tables are perfect for trade shows, special events, traveling exhibits, temporary installations, and broadcast. Ideum is known for its quality builds, iconic designs and push-button operation. Ideum's touch tables have appeared in cutting-edge technology blogs such as Engadget, Gizmag, Slashgear, Discovery News, PC Magazine, and many others.

        Custom built in the US, Ideum sells (and now rents!) these tables directly to museums, universities, research labs, retail spaces, and Fortune 500 companies. The tables are designed specifically for public spaces. Set up is simple, the tables do not require a technician or assembly, they come in a wheeled ATA travel case, ready to plug in and turn on.
        <br><br>
        The Platform 46 and 32 multitouch tables use a non-optical touch technology developed by 3M and can work in any lighting environment. The tables are water resistant (IP54 rating) and use the same touch technology found in tablets and smart phones. They are bezel-free and can work in demanding environments such as restaurants, cafes, bars, and nightclubs, so they are well equipped for special events and tradeshows.
