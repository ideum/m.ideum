    <p> <br>
        The emergence of 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) LCD screens marks a new chapter in large-scale interactive displays. The four-fold improvement in resolution vs. standard HD screens makes a huge impact for displays where the user is just an arm's length away. New UHD displays have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 vs. 1920 x 1080 for an HD display.

        The resolution of a display is measured by the number individual pixels displayed. A 4K UHDTV display is 8.3 megapixels at 3840 wide by 2160 pixels tall. This is four times as many pixels as are found in an HD monitor, which has less than 2.1 megapixels at 1920 by 1080.

        <h2>Six Years and 11 Times the Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            It is hard to believe, but just six years ago in 2008, the first Microsoft Surface touch table was released with a resolution of 1024 x 768 (only .78 megapixels). That early multitouch table didn&apos;t even use LCD technology, a projector was incorporated into the base. How times have changed. A 4K UHD display has nearly 11 times the resolution of the first Microsoft Surface multitouch table!
            <br><br>
            It is pretty easy to argue that 4K displays present the biggest development in multitouch tables and touch walls since the advent of LCD displays. Because users are so close the screen as they interact (as opposed to sitting on the couch), UHD is particularly meaningful for touch tables and wall applications. With a 4K display, users no longer complain of seeing &quot;pixels&quot;, whereas in standard HD displays, particularly larger screens such as 70&quot; or 82&quot;, it can be hard not to see individual pixels.

        <h2>New Designs for High Resolution 4K Applications</h2>
        <p>
            With four times the number of pixels than HD, there are some new challenges and opportunities in designing new interactive applications for 4K displays. Applications, graphics and videos designed for HD won&apos;t look any better on a 4K display (it may actually look worse as it is &quot;interpolated&quot; into the larger screen format). Native 4K applications will look stunning on the new displays: better resolution means graphics and text look crisper, photographs and videos look more realistic.
            <br><br>
            Better quality graphics mean that users can more easily scan documents and not have to constantly zoom in to view details. This allows users to more easily &quot;keep their place&quot; while browsing large sets of information. 4K resolution requires better hardware: newer graphic cards and processors. However, recent improvements in hardware are keeping pace and these improved computer components are about the same price or cheaper than those that power standard HD displays.

        <h2>Integrating 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) Displays in Touch Tables and Walls</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond the massive improvement in resolution, 55&quot; and 65&quot; 4K displays are the same size and similar in brightness and most other qualities with their predecessors. Since the differences in form are slight, 4K displays are relatively easy to integrate into existing (and tried and true) multitouch table and wall designs. That's exactly what we've done at Ideum with our multitouch tables and touch walls.

            All of our multitouch tables and walls are built for demanding environments such as public spaces. We use aircraft-grade aluminum for the screen enclosures and touch table chassis. Set-up is simple, they are ready to plug in and turn on. Whether HD or UHD, our multitouch tables and walls remain the best-built integrated touch products available.

            All of our 55", 65", and 100" multitouch tables are available with 4K UHD displays. Ideums signature tables, the Platform, Pro, Pro Lab, Pano, and the new Platform Drafting Multitouch Tables are now even more incredible when combined with a 4K UHD display. Integrated with powerful 4K compatible computers, and capable of up to 40 simultaneous touch points, the tables are outfitted for the performance needed to support eye-popping ultra high definition and multiuser interaction. The UHD version of the 100" Pano has an amazing 7540 x 2160 resolution. The 4K UHD Platform 55 Drafting Multitouch Table is now available to rent for events and trade shows.

            The massive 65&quot; Presenter touch wall and the Presenter 55 are more touchable than ever. With the intensity of 4K UHD, the Presenter is not only big in size, it's big in resolution. The versatility of the Presenter 55, available with 12 or up to 40 touch points, is further enhanced by a stunning picture in 4K. These touch walls are still incredibly thin (less than 3 inches) and are tough enough for use in public spaces. The Presenter and Presenter 55 can be purchased with a high performing integrated computer for single push-button power.
